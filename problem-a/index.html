    <p>Joel Miller (TV) is the protagonist in <cite> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_(TV_series)">The Last of Us</a>. </cite> 
        He is a middle-aged survivor who is troubled by his past in the start of the apocalypse. </p>

    <p>Reasons why Joel Miller is my king:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>He is seriously badass. For a middle-aged man with deafness in one ear and aching joints dude is absolutely spectacular.</li>
        <li>He is an amazing father figure, especially considering they're in an apocalypse and Ellie is not his real daughter (and Ellie is incredibly annoying).</li>
        <li>Despite being the protagonist, he still has flaws, which the show is fully willing to show, which gives Joel lots of depth as a character.</li>
    </ul>
